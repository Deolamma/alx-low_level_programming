# C - Search Algorithms
### In this project I explore search algorithms and the space complexity associatedwith certain search algorithms. Some of the concepts I cover include:
[][]
- What search algorithms are?
- Difference between Linear and Binary search
- Space complexity associated with each search algorithm
- What Search algorithm to use and when it should be used.
- Space complexity in terms of auxilliary space and input size. Also, Space complexity as just Auxilliary space.
