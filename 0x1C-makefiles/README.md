# MAKE FILES
### In this project I explore the concepts of enhancing my build time by harnessingthe power and capabilities of make file. Some of the concepts understood while working on this project includes:
- What make files are and how they're executed
- What rules are. Differences between implicit and explicit rules.
- Phony targets and how to specify them to avoid confusing the compiler.
- Using variables when creating my make files.
- When, why and how to set and use make files.
